I'm choosing this data because I work with Fusion users and I want to understand their learning needs on a larger scale on our forums. I also want to understand trends in the forums and understand forums activity. I am planning to use our forums website as the data. I have access to Lithium for activity analytics and Clarabridge for sentiment analysis.
